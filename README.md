Week 6: Web Development with Java and Spring Framework
Welcome to the repository for Week 6 and 7 of our Java learning journey. This week marked the beginning of backend web development using Java, covering fundamental concepts of Servlets, Spring Framework, RESTful services, and multi-layer architecture using H2 Database.

How to Use This Repository

Overview:
These weeks were focused on transitioning from core Java to web application development. We started by building basic Servlets using Apache Tomcat, then moved into Spring – the most widely used Java framework. 
We explored how to create RESTful APIs, handle HTTP requests, and build structured multi-layer applications connected to in-memory databases like H2 and MySQL.

Topics Covered:
Tomcat Servlet – Simple Login and HTTP Handling
  - Introduction to Web Servers and Apache Tomcat
  - Setting up a dynamic web project
  - Writing Servlets for HTTP GET and POST requests
  - Simple Login validation using HTML form and Java Servlet
  - Understanding web.xml configuration and HttpServlet

Spring Introduction – Hello App
  - Introduction to Spring Framework
  - Setting up a Spring Boot project
  - Understanding project structure (pom.xml, @SpringBootApplication)
  - Creating a simple Hello World REST Controller
  - Running the Spring Boot application

Spring REST API Calls and Request Handling – Greeting App
  - Building REST APIs with Spring Boot
  - Understanding HTTP methods: GET, POST
  - Using @RestController, @RequestMapping, @RequestParam, and @PathVariable
  - Creating a Greeting Application that responds with dynamic messages
  - Introduction to Postman for API testing

Spring Framework and Multi-Layer Development with H2 DB – Employee Payroll
  - Introduction to layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
  - Connecting Spring Boot to H2 in-memory database
  - Performing CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA
  - Creating an Employee Payroll Application
  - Using @Entity, @Repository, @Service, and @RestController annotations

Prerequisites:
  - Basic understanding of Java and object-oriented programming
  - Completion of Weeks 1 to 5
  - JDK 8 or later, Apache Tomcat, and IDE with Spring Boot support (STS)
  - Internet access for dependency resolution (Maven/Gradle)

How to Use This Repository:
Explore each day’s folder for project files, example code, and instructions. Run the applications locally, test endpoints via browser or Postman, and modify code for hands-on learning. 
Each project is self-contained and includes basic setup and run instructions.
